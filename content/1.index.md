affective AI
#description
- AI holds huge promise, but we need to think differently
- The future of AI (and humans!) is not about automation, or just doing more of the same
- For the first time we can bypass the effect of feelings and emotion in decision making
::

Judges give out harsher sentences when they're hungry. Economists are no better than plumbers at predicting recessions. Asset managers' stock picking decisions provide no more value than if they'd made no decision at all.  These professions inhabit a world where there is no knowable 'truth', only a best guess at the point a decision is made.  We know these guesses are dominated by feelings and mostly away from the rest of the world (in people's heads or behind closed doors).

We now have the ability, with large language models, to analyse processes that were previously hidden from view. Supporting both the individuals that are making the decisions and the general public in understanding how they are made.
